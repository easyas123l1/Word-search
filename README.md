This React Project is a WordSearch generator for kids that will have a bad word filter.  The plan is to have multiple size WordSearch to choose from
able to enter a finite amount of words/word length depending on size of WordSearch.  After the generate button is hit the program will render a WordSearch
with the words provided at the size provided.  Then the user will be able to solve WordSearch in the application or print the WordSearch out for fun without 
a computer.  

Further addition to the application could include a save feature, load feature, top WordSearch, etc..
