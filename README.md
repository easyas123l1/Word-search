This React Project is a search-word generator for kids that will have a bad word filter.  The plan is to have multiple size search-words to choose from
able to enter a finite amount of words/word length depending on size of search-word.  After the generate button is hit the program will render a search-word
with the words provided at the size provided.  Then the user will be able to solve search-word in the application or print the search-word out for fun without 
a computer.  

Further addition to the application could include a save feature, load feature, top search-words, etc..
